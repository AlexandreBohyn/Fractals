# Mandelbrot set
In this section we define the Mandelbrot set and give the code for visualisation in Python and JavaScript.

## A bit of history...
Thes Mandelbrot set was first investigated in the 20th century by the French mathematicians Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia (see the [Julia Set](julia_set.md)). It was popularized in 1980 thanks the visualization of the set created by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot), who worked at IBM at the time.

## Mathematical definition
The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers $c$ where the function $f_c(z) = z^2 +c$ remains bounded when iterated in zero.

Less formally, it is all the complex numbers for which the sequence
$$ f_c(0), f_c(f_c(0)), f_c(f_c(f_c(0))), \ldots $$
doesn't goes to infinity and is bounded by a certain value.

Knowing that $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$, we can write the sequence as
$$ c, c^2 + c, (c^2+c)^2 + c, \ldots $$
Where the complex number $c$ can be written as number with a real part ($a$) and an imaginary part ($b$)
$$ c = a + bi \text{.}$$
